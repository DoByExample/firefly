# FireFly [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ariejan/firefly.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ariejan/firefly)

FireFly is a simple URL shortener for personal (or enterprise) use.

## About Firefly 2.0

Firefly 2.0 is currently in development, `master` may be unstable or 
not even work at all. Check the [1-5-stable][1-5-stable]
branch if you need an URL shortener today.

The `master` branch contains the next version, 2.0.0-pre, of Firefly and is
not suitable for any kind of serious use at this time.

## Background

Firefly was started in 2009 as side project to dive into the world of URL
shorteners. I've been using Firefly since then for my own domain and many 
others have joined me.

After writing the last 1.5.x release in 2011 I kind of forgot about Firefly.

Nearing the end of 2015 I picked it Firefly up again and I'm now in the 
process of dusting of the cobwebs and giving Firefly a beautiful make-over.
