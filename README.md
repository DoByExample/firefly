# About Firefly 2.0

Firefly 2.0 is a complete rewrite of Firefly. If you're looking to have a
working install of Firefly, use the [latest 1.5.3 version](https://github.com/ariejan/firefly/tree/1-5-stable)

The `master` branch contains the next version, 2.0, of Firefly and is
not suitable at this time for any kind of serious use.
