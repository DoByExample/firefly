# FireFly [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ariejan/firefly.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ariejan/firefly)

FireFly is a simple URL shortener for personal (or enterprise) use.

## Use Firefly right now

Currently you should head over to the [1-5-stable][1-5-stable] branch to get started today.

## About Firefly 2.0

`master` is a work-in-progress for 2.0, but is at this time not ready for any kind of use. 
A rewrite, using Hanami, is in the works to be the basis for 2.0, see pull request #55 for details.

## Background

Firefly was started in 2009 as side project to dive into the world of URL
shorteners. I've been using Firefly since then for my own domain and many 
others have joined me.

After writing the last 1.5.x release in 2011 I kind of forgot about Firefly.

Nearing the end of 2015 I picked it Firefly up again and I'm now in the 
process of dusting of the cobwebs and giving Firefly a beautiful make-over.
