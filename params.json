So, if you want to use Postgres, comment out\r\nthe `mysql2` and `sqlite3` gems, like so:\r\n\r\n    gem 'pg'\r\n    # gem 'mysql2'\r\n    # gem 'sqlite3'\r\n\r\nNext, open up `config/database.yml` and `config/firefly.yml` and configure\r\neverything according to your needs.\r\n\r\n### Bundle\r\n\r\nRun `bundle install` to install all gem dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Create your database\r\n\r\n#### Postgres\r\n\r\nJust create a new database:\r\n\r\n    psql -c 'create database firefly_test;'\r\n\r\n#### MySQL\r\n\r\nMake sure to create a database that uses the `utf8` character set and\r\n`utf8_bin` collation. This is to ensure MySQL can lookup case sensitive strings.\r\n\r\n    mysql -e 'create database firefly_test character set utf8 collate utf8_bin;'\r\n\r\n#### Sqlite3\r\n\r\nNothing special to do here.\r\n\r\n### Run migrations\r\n\r\n    rake db:migrate\r\n\r\n### Start your Firefly\r\n\r\n    rackup\r\n\r\n## Supported rubies\r\n\r\nThe entire spec suite is run against the latest ruby-1.9.2 and ruby-1.9.3. These\r\nare the officially supported rubies.\r\n\r\nThe spec suite is also run against Rubinius in 1.9-mode and ruby-head. Although\r\nI strife to get these builds passing, they are not officially supported by me at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\njruby, ruby-1.8.x and others are currently not supported.\r\n\r\n## Deployments to Heroku\r\n\r\nHeroku is a popular deploy target and is fully supported by Firefly. There's\r\nnothing holding you back from deploying to Heroku, except that the \r\n`config/database.yml` and `config/firefly.yml` files a currently ignored by git.\r\n\r\nEdit, `.gitignore` and remove the entries for these files, commit your changes\r\nand push to Heroku.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nI develop against Postgres and have Travis run the specs against MySQL and\r\nsqlite3. \r\n\r\nTo get your own environment setup, follow the installation guide, with the \r\nfollowing twist:\r\n\r\n * Don't comment out the database gems. If you can't or don't want to install\r\ndatabase specific gems, feel free to comment them out, but don't ever commit\r\nthese changes\r\n\r\nThen you should be able to run the spec suite like so:\r\n\r\n    RACK_ENV=test rake\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nFirefly was started in 2009 as side project to dive into the world of URL\r\nshorteners. I've been using Firefly since then for my own domain and many \r\nothers have joined me.\r\n\r\nAfter writing the last 1.5.x release in 2011 I kind of forgot about Firefly.\r\nNearing the end of 2012 I picked it up again and I'm now in the process of\r\ndusting of the cobwebs and giving Firefly a nice make-over.\r\n\r\n## Note on Patches, Pull Requests and Issues\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an issue with Firefly, please feel free to create an issue\r\nin [Github Issues][issues].\r\n\r\nIn case you want to contribute, fork the project, create a feature or\r\nbugfix branch and sen in a pull request.\r\n\r\n*I prefer pull requests with only added failing specs over a pull request\r\nwith working code and no specs.*\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n**Author**: Ariejan de Vroom\r\n**URL**: [http://ariejan.net][ariejannet]\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nSee [LICENSE][license] for more information.\r\n\r\n[issues]: https://github.com/ariejan/firefly/issues\r\n[1-5-stable]: https://github.com/ariejan/firefly/tree/1-5-stable\r\n[ariejannet]: http://ariejan.net\r\n[license]: https://github.com/ariejan/firefly/blob/master/LICENSE\r\n"}
